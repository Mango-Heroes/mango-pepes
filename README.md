Therefore, it was a natural extension for Mango Markets as the decentralized traders platform to have its own stylized meme-able pepes.

We will continue to add over time but these are some of my favorite. They aren’t mintable NFTs and that was really the intention — for them to be free, circulate, and join in the trading culture.
